# ExpoAssistant

An AI assistant to help people get around in a science fair! It also takes feedback!

</center>

ExpoAssistant, or ExpoBot is a collection of python applications which work together to create an AI assistant to help people get around in a science fair.

It is designed to make sure all people can get all the information they need, and to make sure that the science fair is a fun experience for everyone.

It also takes feedback, so that the fair can improve itself and become better the next year. It does this by tagging people's faces with their feedback, and then saving it to a CSV file.
